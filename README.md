# etl_algo
This pipeline leverages second-derivative Jacobian matrices to automate an ETL process previously considered too complex for generalizable resolution. By reframing the transformation logic as a solvable optimization landscape, the algorithm bypasses traditional bottlenecks and achieves reproducibility across multi-domain inputs; TCP-DI ingested,.
